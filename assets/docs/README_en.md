## Introduction
"Nagato Sakura Image Charm" is a derivative of the "Nagato Sakura Project," a graphical image enhancement and evaluation tool based on the image core of "Nagato Sakura." It supports AI super-resolution, image and video enhancement, quality assessment, and other features.

## Announcement
Added support for Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), now you can use hardware acceleration on Apple systems.
NS-IC-Kairitsu-v7pro-370 and NS-IC-Ritsuka-LQ-v7-228(Beta) are not included in the built-in model list, please download models from Github model space.

## Recent Changes
### 1.2.1 (July 15, 2025)
![t2i](https://github.com/AmanoShizukikun/Nagato-Sakura-Image-Charm/blob/main/assets/preview/1.2.1.jpg)
### Important Changes
- [Major] Added support for Apple Metal Performance Shaders (MPS), now you can use hardware acceleration on Apple systems.
- [Major] Removed ExtractUtility.py, eliminated decompression functionality.
### New Features
- [New] Video processing functionality now includes NS-C model recommendation feature.
- [Update] Optimized NS-C model invocation method, resources are automatically released after use.
- [Update] Optimized benchmark test startup efficiency, collecting system information in background threads to avoid UI blocking.
- [Fix] Fixed issue where model recommendation feature couldn't be used on some systems and in light mode.
- [Fix] Fixed issue where video processing would crash when opening folder dialog after completing video processing on MacOS.
- [Fix] Fixed issue where selecting a model from the model list after downloading would result in being unable to use that model when no models exist and clicking "No" in the new model dialog.
### Known Issues
- [Bug] Super-resolution image preview size differs from original image, making intuitive comparisons difficult.
- [Bug] Plugin management feature is incomplete. Version 1.2.0 and later will forcibly pre-install the Nagato-Sakura-Image-Quality-Assessment image scoring functionality (approximately 1MB).
- [Bug] Plugin management feature is incomplete. Version 1.2.0 and later will forcibly pre-install the Nagato-Sakura-Image-Classification (NS-C) model recommendation functionality (approximately 16MB).
- [Bug] MacOS crashes when running full image evaluation with two images present simultaneously.
- [Bug] Linux crashes due to missing fonts when running full image evaluation with two images present simultaneously.
- [Bug] MacOS/Linux download page text overlaps on preview box.

### Important Changes
- [Major] Officially introduced Nagato-Sakura-Image-Classification (NS-C) image classification model as a model recommendation plugin into the system.
- [Major] Changed the model architecture of Nagato-Sakura-Image-Classification (NS-C), from the original ResNet-19 to a more lightweight EfficientNet-B0.
### New Features
- [New] Image processing page and image evaluation page now include NS-C functionality, which can recommend the most suitable NS-IQE model based on input images.
- [New] Kairitsu ninth-generation general-purpose realistic JPEG compression restoration model.
### Known Issues
- [Bug] Super-resolution image preview size differs from original image, making intuitive comparisons difficult.
- [Bug] Plugin management feature is incomplete. Version 1.2.0 will forcibly pre-install the Nagato-Sakura-Image-Quality-Assessment image scoring functionality (approximately 1MB).
- [Bug] Plugin management feature is incomplete. Version 1.2.0 will forcibly pre-install the Nagato-Sakura-Image-Classification (NS-C) model recommendation functionality (approximately 16MB).

### 1.1.1 (May 04, 2025)
![t2i](https://github.com/AmanoShizukikun/Nagato-Sakura-Image-Charm/blob/main/assets/preview/1.1.1.jpg)
### Important Changes
- [Major] Completely rewrote the AI image scoring core model architecture, abandoning the large Transformer model in favor of a traditional CNN model, with architecture optimization for lightweight processing.
### New Features
- [New] Added edge comparison functionality to the evaluation page, allowing image edge comparison using OpenCV Canny.
- [Update] Updated the UI layout of the evaluation page, replacing the bottom preview scrolling box with a more flexible views.py style.
- [Update] Optimized the model description for Ritsuka-HQ.
- [Fix] AI image scoring model completely rewritten, now requiring only about 1MB of space for good AI scoring results.
### Known Issues
- [Bug] Super-resolution image preview size differs from original image, making intuitive comparisons difficult.
- [Bug] Plugin management feature is incomplete. Version 1.1.1 will forcibly pre-install the Nagato-Sakura-Image-Quality-Assessment image scoring functionality (approximately 1MB).
